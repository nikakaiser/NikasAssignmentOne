            <p class="narrarator">Humans have finally found a way to make space travel accessible to the general population. <br> New “space-ports” have begun to send people into space. </p>
            <p class="narrarator"> While walking down the street one day, Johnny was caught off guard when someone with an official looking clipboard interrupted his meditative stroll.</p>
         
            <p class="guy">“Hey! Where do YOU want to go first now that space travel is possible for average guys like you?” </p>
            <p class="narrarator">Johnny hadn’t thought much about it. In all honesty johnny has never much thought about anything, nonetheless where in the cosmos he would like to go. </p>
            <p class="johnny"> “I don’t know. Some place without cats I suppose” </p>
            <p class="guy">“Without cats? Do you hate cats that much? Cats can be mean and annoying but when you get used to them, they are adorable! However, to prove that to you, let’s try a place with cats all over the place for few days. Then you can go to the place you wanted to go, without cats. What do you think about that?“</p>
            <p class="johnny"> “I’m down”</p>
        
        
            <p class="narrarator">And with that, Johnny was in a spaceship, off to a planet that was apparently filled with cats. When he landed, a human-sized cat standing on it’s hind legs came to the space-gate to greet him.</p>
        
            <p class="Felix"> “Hello Johnny, my name is Felix” </p>
            <p class="johnny"> "Hi"</p>
            <p class="narrarator">Although he would have rather gone somewhere without cats, he had never seen a human sized cat before, and he thought it was pretty cool. </p>
